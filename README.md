# DrawTxO
Visualization and animation library for Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTxOs)

The goal of this repository is to create a resource for understanding and using Unspent Transaction Outputs, or UTxOs.
While first utilized in the seminal [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) as a method for representing discrete units of value passed into and the outputs of Bitcoin transactions, they have quickly become a critical component to understanding tokenization in a blockchain context, and have wide-ranging implications beyond the current implementations.
