# Choice of Programming Language

When considering a proper language to develop this project in, priorities must be considered:

1. Easy to use and accessible to many types of developers
2. A rigorous type system to express the UTxOs and their transformations
3. A suitable visual and/or animation library that can translate UTxO interactions into images
4. A way to formally verify or trace all paths through the creation and interactions of UTxOs
